        <h2>My Story</h2><br/>
        <p> Hi, I’m Genny—sourdough baker, joyful food lover, and founder of Get Bready with Genny. My journey with food hasn’t always been easy. After losing 90 pounds and working through disordered eating, I spent years redefining what food meant to me. For a long time, I saw it only as fuel—something to control, not enjoy. But baking changed everything.</p><br/>
        <p>Sourdough became my therapy. It taught me that food can be both nourishing and joyful. It helped me heal, slow down, and find beauty in the process of creating something from scratch. I dove into research on gut health, fermentation, and flour science—not just for myself, but to bring that care and intention to every loaf I bake.</p><br/>
        <p>I even named my business with a pun—Get Bready with Genny—because I believe homemade goods should be fun, heartfelt, and a little playful. Though I’m early in my business journey, I see that as a strength. While big bakeries focus on scale, I focus on people. I listen to what my customers want, take special requests, and put genuine love into every bake.</p><br/>
        <p>This isn’t just about bread. It’s about feeding your loved ones, supporting your community, and remembering that food should nourish the soul—not just the body. I built this brand to show that homemade, heartfelt things still matter in a world that’s already onto the next big thing.</p><br/>
